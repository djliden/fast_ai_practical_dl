# 2020 fast.ai Practical Deep Learning for Coders Study Group
Collective wisdom of the fast_ai_practical_dl TWIML study group

## Background
This repository contains resources found and/or developed by the [TWIML fast.ai Deep Learning for Coders Study Group](https://twimlai.com/program/fast-ai-practical-deep-learning-for-coders-study-group/). Lectures and course materials can be found [here](https://course.fast.ai/). Study group meetings are organized on the TWIML Community Slack server's `fast_ai_practical_dl` channel. To gain access to the Slack server, join the TWIML Community [here](https://twimlai.com/community/).

#### Chapter 5: Image Classification
- [Book Chapter](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/05_pet_breeds.ipynb)
- Demo of Transfer Learning in Fastai: [Notebook](notebooks/(Un)freezing%20and%20Transfer%20Learning.ipynb)
#### Chapter 6: Other Computer Vision Problems
- [Book Chapter](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/06_multicat.ipynb)
#### Chapter 8: Collaborative Filtering Deep Dive
- [Book Chapter](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/08_collab.ipynb)
- [Collaborative Learning with Book Crossing Dataset](notebooks/Collaborative%20Filtering%20Book%20Recommendations%20V2.ipynb): This rough notebook walks through some of the sections of chapter 8 using the [book crossing dataset](http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~cziegler/BX/) instead of the MovieLens dataset used in the chapter.
- Embedding Demonstration using Excel Spreadsheets: for a more visual step-by-step walkthrough of the embeddings demonstrated in chapter 8, see [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2h3IOBDvrA&feature=youtu.be&list=PLfYUBJiXbdtS2UQRzyrxmyVHoGW0gmLSM&t=6147). An accompanying spreadsheet, prepared by the organizer of this study group, Andy Nakamura, can be downloaded [here](files/movies-for-study-group.xlsx).
#### Chapter 9: Tabular Modeling Deep Dive
- [Book Chapter](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/09_tabular.ipynb)
- Page 278 mentions an "online-only chapter" replcating the approach taken by one of the gold medalists of the Kaggle *Rossman Sales Competition* which used a "state-of-the-art deep learning model" with embeddings. Two notesbooks with material related to this model/competition can be found here [1](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/blob/master/dev_nbs/course/lesson6-rossmann.ipynb) [2](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/blob/master/dev_nbs/course/rossman_data_clean.ipynb) (they appear to still be in development).
#### Chapter 10: NLP Deep Dive: RNNs
- [Book Chapter](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/10_nlp.ipynb)
- [MIT Technology Review Article on GPT-3](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/07/20/1005454/openai-machine-learning-language-generator-gpt-3-nlp/): OpenAI's GPT-3 model provides a good example of the potential -- and limitations -- of a modern, state-of-the-art language model. The linked article provides a good discussion of the areas where GPT-3 succeeds and where there is more work to be done.
